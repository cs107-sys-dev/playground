# Playground
## Vikram is taking CS 107 and is learning the command line (something he has never used for 15+ years) and GitHub (something he has never used at all!)


A place to play with `git`.

### Fall 2020
Dear grader, 

Just a quick FYI, CSCI E-207 is the only class I am taking this 
semester than has a coding component. As such, there is no /classes
directory in my GitHub folder. I spoke to one of the teaching 
assistants, who said that I don't need the /classes directory since
I am not doing any other coding work this semester. 

I hope you are staying healthy and well amidst everything happening
in the world at the moment. 

Best regards,
Vikram
